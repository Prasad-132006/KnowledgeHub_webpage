            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers
                to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.
                Instead of following fixed instructions, ML systems identify patterns and make decisions
                based on experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Machine Learning is widely used in real-life applications such as recommendation systems
                (Netflix, YouTube), spam email filtering, voice assistants, image recognition, and
                self-driving cars.
            </p>

            <p><b>Types of Machine Learning:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Supervised Learning</b> – Learning using labeled data</li>
                <li><b>Unsupervised Learning</b> – Finding patterns in unlabeled data</li>
                <li><b>Reinforcement Learning</b> – Learning through rewards and penalties</li>

            <h2>Beginner Guide to Java</h2>
            <p>
                Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems.
                It follows the principle of <b>"Write Once, Run Anywhere"</b>, which means Java programs
                can run on any platform that supports Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
            </p>

            <p>
                Java is widely used for building web applications, Android apps, enterprise software,
                banking systems, and backend services.
            </p>

            <p><b>Key Features of Java:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Object-Oriented</li>
                <li>Platform Independent</li>
                <li>Secure and Robust</li>
                <li>Multithreaded</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Java is an excellent choice for beginners because of its strong community support,
                extensive libraries, and long-term industry demand.

            <h2>Basics of Networking & Internet</h2>
            <p>
                Computer Networking is the practice of connecting multiple computers and devices
                to share data, resources, and services. A network allows communication between
                systems using wired or wireless technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that enables services
                such as websites, emails, file sharing, video streaming, and online communication.
            </p>

            <p><b>Key Networking Concepts:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>IP Address</b> – A unique identifier for devices on a network</li>
                <li><b>DNS</b> – Converts domain names into IP addresses</li>
                <li><b>Protocols</b> – Rules for data communication (HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP)</li>
                <li><b>Client-Server Model</b> – Clients request services, servers respond</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Networking knowledge is essential for careers in web development, cybersecurity,
                cloud computing, and system administration.

            <h2>Understanding Databases and SQL</h2>
            <p>
                A database is an organized collection of data that allows efficient storage,
                retrieval, and management of information. Databases are widely used in applications
                such as banking systems, websites, mobile apps, and enterprise software.
            </p>

            <p>
                SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with databases. It allows
                users to create tables, insert data, retrieve records, update values, and delete data.
            </p>

            <p><b>Types of Databases:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Relational Databases</b> – MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle</li>
                <li><b>NoSQL Databases</b> – MongoDB, Cassandra</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Common SQL Commands:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>SELECT</b> – Fetch data from a table</li>
                <li><b>INSERT</b> – Add new records</li>
                <li><b>UPDATE</b> – Modify existing data</li>
                <li><b>DELETE</b> – Remove records</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Understanding databases and SQL is crucial for backend development, data analysis,
                and full-stack application development.
